## Difficulties



## Pre-requisite
In order to get a better understanding of the project, you need to have prior knowledge in the following subjects:
- Mathematics: Linear Algebra (Basic)
- Programming: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Acknowledgments
The idea for this project came from Radu Mariescu-Istodor, a YouTuber and a Computer Science Ph.D. who gave me the motivation and insight on how neural networks can be applied to driving cars.
